## Because I can
* * * 

I love building stuff and it should come as no suprise that
I have tinkered with the arduino. Sadly though I have never
really built anything uber usefull with it. The Butler project
got dismantled after moving houses and I havent had
a need to use it at my current residence.

So with that out of the way this is the first bit of code
that goes beyond hello world that I have written for the arduino.
It will display a message of your choice on an LCD and then
slowly scroll to the end. Once it reaches the end it will
then reverse direction and scroll back to the start. If you
dont want it to reverse direction the code is easy enough to
change so that it starts display the start of the message 
instead.

You can find the code over @ https://gist.github.com/3299197

If you find any bug/issues ping me and I will fix it or submit
a pull request.
