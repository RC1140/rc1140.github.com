### Know Pain

So I completed my first road race using a road bike yesterday, compared to DualX the race 
was much easier seeing as I was able to drive home after the race. 

### Organization and general issues

The race organization was excellent, getting into the event and finding a parking spot was
 easy as was leaving the event. The distance between the parking and the start line was 
tarred so it was pretty easy to hop on your bike and ride to the start line. The starting 
pens were clearly marked off and constant anouncements were made alerting people when they 
should start approaching the start pens and to which pens they should enter. The biggest 
issue at these events (especially one of this size) is finding a toilet in time. Thankfully
 not only was the usual porta potties available, the staduims facilities were also available
 for use which meant there was no queuing at all. I think this was the first time I have 
ever attended a race where there was no queue and it was amazing :P. In hindsight I didnt
 actually encounter any post race issues at that event.  

### The Ride

The race did not start with the cyclist riding straight out of the pens, instead, the 
organizers would empty each pen onto the road which was a 100m or so away from the pens 
and gave the rides a bit more space to launch from.
Getting out of the pens and onto the road leading to the start line was mostly un eventfull
 except for someone that managed to fall down before the starting gun was even fired while
 everyone was standing still.

I hung back on purpose and tried to find a mostly out of the way spot in the bunch since I 
wasnt sure exactly what to expect. In hindsight, this was a horrible decision and I should 
have tried to get as close to the front as possible. Since I had never participated in a 
road race before, I had no seeding which meant that I was pretty far in the back. This meant
 that I was constantly blocked by little groups of riders that to me felt as if they were 
not moving. This was thankfully only really an issue in the first 5km's roughly as after 
that the group started to thin out enough that I could overtake at will.

I had really underestimated my riding pace so before the race I expected that I would be 
averaging 20-22km/h over the race. In the end on most of the flats and downhills which was
 mostly the first half of the race, I averaged 31km/h while my overall average for the race
 including the climbs was 28km/h (this is based on my personal time and excludes the pause
 for my flat tire). 

Roughly just before the first water point I hit a bump that I am pretty sure caused me to 
get a pinch flat. Because I have never gotten a puncture on any of my previous races I 
wasnt sure if what I was feeling on the bike was a bad road or a puncture. So I stopped at
 the water point and topped up the air in the tire, in hindsight I should have replaced the
 tire at this point as I may have had some assistance. I had not traveled over a kilometer
 or so when I started to get the same feedback from the bike, at this point I was fairly 
certain that It was a puncture and had to pull over as soon as I could find some clear 
ground on the side of the road. Seeing as I had almost zero experiance changing the tire
 in the middle of a race, the change ended up costing me way too much time (almost 8 minutes). 
This was mostly due to me double checking that I actually needed to change the tube and 
then finally the effort required to get the tube in and the tire closed.

The race was mostly un eventful after this, which meant that I could focus on trying to 
push out as much power as possible without putting me into the zone where I start cramping. 
This was pretty much what I ended up doing after the puncture as I tried as hard as possible 
to catch up to the people that had passed me while I was busy with my repair. Over the next 
15mins I easily caught up with a number of people that I had spotted previously and slowly 
started getting back to the point where I was attacking new riders on a regular basis.

If there is one thing that I absolutely loved about the race it was that I was constantly 
attacking, this happened on both the downhills as well as the uphills (which I did not 
expect would happen). There were roughly two other riders that I ecountered that were able
 to pace me and not have me feel like I was not moving. Sadly I lost the first rider when 
I stopped at the water point to refill and lost the other rider on one of the longer uphills
 where she slowed a bit. 

It was also quite interesting to see the difference between the different types of riders 
in the race. In my group, I mostly encountered the rider that was just trying to get to 
the end of the race (I thought this is the group I would be in as well), the other group 
in the short race consisted of smaller bunches of more experiance rider which would 
occasionally slingshot me in the coolest manner. Towards the end of the race I encountered
 the longer group fast rider who would always ride as a bunch (who I could also never keep
 up with), this is in comparison to the larger group of short distance cyclist who never 
rode as group or drafted at all and instead preffered to ride side by side which meant they 
were always working themselves to death for no good reason.

### Fin

In the end this was a great race to start the year on. I now really want to find a group 
to train with since it was pretty clear that I am not pushing myself nearly hard enough on
 my weekend rides. I left the race feeling like I gave it my all and would gladly do it 
again, the pain that came after my recovery sleep wasnt nearly as bad as I thought it would
 be, but still appeared in the form of major neck tension and soreness in my joints.
