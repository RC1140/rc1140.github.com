### Soweto Marathon

Having completed the soweto marathon 21km last year and in addition to some prodding from my 
cousin I finally did my first full marathon this year. The race happened on the 6 Nov 2016
and it was definitely a milestone in my athletic adventures. I have been doing half marathons
for a while now and kept putting of a full marathon because I figured it want much different
than getting ready for a half marathon. After proving myself completely wrong I have to say 
I still enjoyed the race completely. The soweto is one of the harder marathons in jhb (and
according to some in SA) and the race definitely showed me that I need to still up my game
when it comes to running. I was originally planning on a 5 hour (or sub 5 if possible) but
this unfortunately never happened. In the last 6kms of the race I lost my legs (there isn't
any other way i can explain that) and had to do short walk + trot sessions till the finish
line. In the end I finished with a time of 5:22:44, in the end I am happy that I could even
finish the race and will just use this as a way to set an easy personal best next time I 
do the race or another marathon. While I may have lost my legs at the end I was definitely
not pushing nearly as hard as I could have as demonstrated by my crazy level of recovery 
over the next week.


### Organization and general issues

The race organization was mostly good. The main issue really comes down to traffic on the
day of the event and not enough marshaling around that. But once parked getting to the
start line was easy and there were plenty of porta potties though I have come to not
rely on them anymore. 

### The run 

I did this run with my cousin who is significantly stronger and fitter than I am and even
though he had never done a full marathon either, he definitely made the race more enjoyable.
While we couldn't talk the entire race (I can barely talk for 15mins so no way I could talk
for 5 hours), the occasional pep talk as he pushed me forward and kept me engaged definitely
made a huge difference to me getting over the finish line.

Running isn't as technical as cycling so there isn't as much to cover , but the hills towards
the end of the race did hit me at the worst possible time.

I also ran with a hydration vest that I was used to training with and that I think I really
needed since my timings were not in sync with the water stations and towards the end it helped
more when stations were dry because I was so far back in the pack. I am not sure what caused
it, but I also go quite nauseous at the end of the race (in sync with when I lost my power to run)
and no matter much I drank I couldn't get hydrated properly. This probably resulted in 
one of the worst feelings I can imagine (trying to run while feeling sick).

### Conclusion

In the end this was a great race. I gave the race everything I had and while I could have 
possibly done better if I had trained harder ahead of time, I am more than happy with the
time that I posted this year.
