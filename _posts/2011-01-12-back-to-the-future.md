title: Back to the future

Getting back to blogging has been something that I have 
wanted to do for ages. But the numerous excuses that keep 
on coming up have slowed me down for long enough.

On of them was that because I am always trying out new tech 
or moving server or in general just fiddling with stuff. As 
such my blog was never really stable. I have backed it up in 
the past but that never really helped since restoring was 
such a chore through and each restart of my blog was a new 
chapter for me both personally and technically.

So with this new blog you should know what is coming. Yes 
you guessed it a new start. While I am not going to announce 
it till next month ,I can say that you will once again start 
seeing some interesting content on here soon.

BTW the title has little relevance to the post(read into it 
what you will) but do stick around for what is to come.
