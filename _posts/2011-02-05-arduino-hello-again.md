title: Arduino hello world again 
---

After what seems like ages I have finally got down to doing stuff on my arduino.

The one thing that I have been meaning to do for ages is to get a LCD I have 
working , its a simple character based LCD (which has 2 rows I think). This
makes doing a hello world app quite simple to do and it actually write out
'hello world' :).

I have had most of the components for this project for ages (minus the potentiometer).
While I dont have much advice to give on this subject (mostly because I dont want to 
re write something that is already out there and done extremely well) you can find the equivalent tutorial of what 
I have done [at ladyada's site](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/lcd/charlcd.html). 

Here are couple of images I managed to take of the end result [1](http://rc1140.github.com/images/1.jpg) [2](http://rc1140.github.com/images/1.jpg) [3](http://rc1140.github.com/images/1.jpg)

From here I hope to finally incorporate this into my universal remote control so that
I know which device I am controlling.
