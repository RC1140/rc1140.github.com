# The Spy Challenge 
* * * 

## Introduction: 

The hackfortress challenge was part of the Schmoocon challenge a few years ago and while I attempted 
them at the time I never fully documented them or completed all of them. So in the next few posts I 
will explain how to complete each of the challenges. The first of the challenges is the spy challenge.

## Getting Started

I will try to complete all the challenges using a unix OS. As such for the most part , most of the tools
that will be used will be command line tools. If its also not completely obvious from my selection of 
command line tools , the aim of this and future posts is to learn assembly and reversing by applying
yourself. The outcome should be an understanding of how things work and an understand of how and why
things were taken appart.

Grabbing the challenges :

To start of run the following code to checkout the code to a local folder.

	git clone git://github.com/peasleer/hackfortress.git

After having checked out all the code its time to tackle the first challenge. To do that run the
following commands which will put you into the spy folder.

	cd hackfortressa/spy

	make
	
Note : While the C code is available , this is a reversing challenge so dont look at the code till
you have attempted to finish the challenge.

After building the project we should have the following file listing : 

-rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 rc1140 1.3K Mar 24 13:21 spy.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 rc1140  197 Mar 24 13:21 README
-rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 rc1140   68 Mar 24 13:21 Makefile
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rc1140 rc1140 5.5K Mar 25 13:10 spy

At this point we can run the binary to see what happens and the following bits of info will be printed
to the console.

	[ H A C K | F O R T R E S S ]
	We've intercepted a secret message, but can't decrypt it. 
	If you provide us with the right key, we'll help your team!

This is the same information that is provided in the README file that come along with the project.As 
such it doesnt give us much more information. The Readme on the other hand further explains that we need to provide
a md5 hash of the message to complete the challenge.

Next its always good to get a dump of all the strings that are in use in the binary. This
will allow us to spot patterns and possibly locations that need to be investigated before
we even get to debugging the binary. To get a dump of all the strings in a binary run the
following command

	strings spy > spyStrings.txt

Aside from extracting the strings this also saves the strings to a file for future reference.

Next before jumping into debugging the binary its good to a listing of the application to 
read through. This will give us a roadmap on how the binary should work before we start
debugging the application. To get a disassembly listing of the binary run the follwing 
command.

	objdump -D -S -f spy > spyDump.txt

The next thing to do is to get the entry pointt for the application. Thankfully this is fairly
easy , if you have been following till now we can get this easily from the spyDump.txt. Simply
open the file and go to line 5 which should contain the following line.

	start address 0x08048460

Voila we now know the entry point of the application which in my case could have been 0x08048460.
If we so wanted we could start reading through the spyDumpt.txt file from that location to 
determine what the application is doing when it starts running.

But before we get there is also useful to know the the how many functions we are dealing with in
the application. To do this we can cheat a bit by making a couple assumptions. First by assuming 
that the authors of the challenge meant it to be a beginners challenge they wouldnt have changed 
the function call type to anything other than cdecl. Now with the cdecl call type the stack
needs to be wound at the begining at a function before the stack can be used. With this in mind
I wrote a very small parser application to extract the text section from the dump and extract
each of the lines of code that wind the stack. Once we have extracted this we know the memory
locations of each of the functions and can use them by adding breakpoints at these locations
when debugging.

To get the function start locations run the script :
	
	python parse.py > functionhandles.txt


Summary of tools used :
	git
	gdb
	objdump
	make
