Gadgets, boy do I really love me some gadgets.  

### Justitifcation

Mostly just because I wanted it , but also because I had just finished a Duathalon and I never wanted to fiddle with my phone in the middle of a race again.

### Worth it ?

Completely, the current device is a GPS device so I have not need to carry my phone with me anymore while still receiving realtime data.

### Fin

With the run over, I am really looking forward to completing a few more this year and hopefully completing a marathon as well. The recording of my race can be found [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/239473050).
