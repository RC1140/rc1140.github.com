Why
--------------

Selected as a projet from githubs trending projects for productivity
as well as its a chrome extension. Further the plugin seems to tackle
a problem that i tried to solve recently in a very clean manner.

Where
--------------

Project is located on github @ https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs.git


Down the rabbit hole
--------------

So cloning the project results in the following 
file listing 

    -rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 users 3.9K Apr 24 20:20 Rakefile                                            
    -rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 users 2.8K Apr 24 20:20 README.markdown                                     
    -rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 users 1.1K Apr 24 20:20 LICENSE                                             
    -rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 users  218 Apr 24 20:20 HACKING                                             
    drwxr-xr-x 2 rc1140 users 4.0K Apr 24 20:20 ext                                                 
    -rw-r--r-- 1 rc1140 users  498 Apr 24 20:20 com.github.dotjs.plist                              
    drwxr-xr-x 2 rc1140 users 4.0K Apr 24 20:20 bin                                                 
A few things seem to stand out , there is a rake file which 
probably means that ruby is involved. Author has also taken
the time to include a hacking file so modifications are expected
to occur or have already happened in the past to warrant this.

Next there is a plist file which is mac/ios file used in apps 
for those operating systems , this either means this plugin is 
    aimed @ mac/iOS users or the file got forgotten behind ?

The rest of the project seems to be split into the extension and
a binary folder. This should prove interesting as it may explain
how the extension accesses the file system (which is usually prohibited by chrome)

README.markdown
-----------------

Since the project includes a readme starting with this should provide
some directions.

Readme gives a nice intro into how the extension works and why you would
want to use it. It also gives a example script very early in the file 
so that you can try stuff out.

It seems the core repo i am looking at is only meant for OSX which would 
explain the plist file i saw earlier. Will continue looking into this repo
and switch to a windows repo when i need to actually test it.

Its also nice that the readme includes direct links to the ports.
